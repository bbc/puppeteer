# Structurizr Puppeteer

This repo contains some Node.js examples of how to script and automate parts of the Structurizr web application using Puppeteer (and headless Chrome) from the command line, perhaps as a part of your build process. Examples of what you can do include:

- Export diagrams and keys to PNG or SVG formats.
- Export all diagrams to a single HTML page for offline use.
